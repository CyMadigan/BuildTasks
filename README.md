# JH - Build & Release Tools
This extension contains helpful build tasks.

1. **Change Assembly Versions**

	This task can version assemblies by using the build number or by manually defining the version number to set.
	This can be done for 3 different versions separately: AssemblyVersion, AssemblyFileVersion and AssemblyInformationalVersion
